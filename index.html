        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Greetings, reader of this website. My name is Joy, and 
           I am a fervent and passionate lover of cats. I am dedicated
           to appreciating these fascinating creatures, and
           I have created this web application to share with you more
           about them.
        </p>

        <h2>Why do I love cats so much?</h2>
        <p>
            Cats have complex yet adorable personalities. They always carry themselves with
            grace, and know how to keep themselves clean and presentable. Intelligent and perceptive,
            they approach every situation skillfully and vigilantly.
        </p>
        <p>
            They may appear arrogant at first glance, but you must put your pride aside and serve
            these classy felines with your most well-refined petting skills. Only then will
            you gain their love and affection as their loyal subjects.
        </p>

        <h2>Here are some examples of how my love for cats shows in my life.</h2>
